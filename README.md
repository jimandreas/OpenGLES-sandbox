Android OpenGL test repo
------------------------

<b>Description</b>

1) A GL Object study - various geometric shapes are studied.

2) A small study on loading the OBJ file format was implemented.

3) The ToroidHelix object can be duplicated in a scene to study the performance of Android graphics.

Have fun looking at these if you like.
