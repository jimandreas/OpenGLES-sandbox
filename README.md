Android OpenGL test repo
------------------------

Extended from this framework: https://github.com/learnopengles/Learn-OpenGLES-Tutorials

## What has changed:

I have added three studies to the start of the over all lesson layout:

1) A GL Object study - various geometric shapes are studied.

2) A small study on loading the OBJ file format was implemented.

3) The ToroidHelix object can be duplicated in a scene to study the performance of Android graphics.

Have fun looking at these if you like.
